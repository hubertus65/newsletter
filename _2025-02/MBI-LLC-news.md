MBI is the only one-stop shop for solutions based on the Modelica Association standards based in the United States. In addition to to sales, 
we also provide services to help you set up your processes to successfully use model based design for innovative product development.    

#### [Tool Updates](https://modelbased.cloud/tools/)

[Modelon Impact](https://modelon.com/modelon-impact/) is our tool of choice for Modelica due to its cloud-based nature that makes collaboration and integration so much easier. 
We offer Modelon Impact with fully supported extensions and add-ons to integrate it with controls design. This includes the [FMI-Toolbox](https://modelon.com/fmi-toolbox/) 
for seamless integration into Simulink and [PMSFIT FMIBench](https://modelbased.cloud/tools/fmi/) for FMI integration and co-simulation, supporting both FMI and SSP.
For [orchideo \| easySSP](https://www.exxcellent.de/orchideo-easy-ssp) we now offer extended examples and getting-started training. 

In the combination of these tools, this covers needs for standards-based system simulation for everything from small customers to enterprise needs. 

#### [Library updates](https://modelbased.cloud/libraries/)
- We are a reseller for [TLK-Energy](https://tlk-energy.de/en) and their [Process Systems Library](https://modelbased.cloud/libraries/psl/). This library is specialized on Power-to-X processes.
- We are a reseller for [TLK_THERMO GmbH](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/en/) and their flagship Library [TIL-Suite](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/en/software/til-suite) for modeling of thermal systems.
- We are a reseller for [XRG Simulation GmbH](https://xrg-simulation.de/en) and their broad portfolio of libraries for Building Simulation [Human Comfort Library](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/humancomfort-library) and [HVAC Library](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/hvac-library), and Machine Learning and Neural Networks [SmartInt+](https://xrg-simulation.de/en/seiten/smartint)

For Libraries, our main Modelica platform is Modelon Impact, but we work with other tools as well, especially for open-source libraries, and extending open-source libraries. Our Library partners offer in addition some add-on productivity-tools that are tailored for their specific simulation domain. They are also available from MBI-LLC.  

#### [Services and Training](https://modelbased.cloud/services/)
Most new users of simulation solutions will need some getting-started services. 

- Training for new and advanced users, for tools, and libraries. We offer advanced Modelica training, as  Here our focus is on controls-oriented modeling and design workflows, and modeling at the right level of complexity for the use case. 
- Customization of products for specific workflows and integration with in-house data and custom tools, es
- Customization and add-ons for commercial modeling libraries. For this, we work with our partners, to that we work with tailored know-how and specialists for all products in our portfolio.
- Development of custom model libraries and solutions
- Getting-started services for Model-Based Design, developing the right processes for your company size and mission, including the integration with systems engineering   

With the above portfolio, [MBI LLC](https://modelbased.cloud/) will select the right solution for you, no matter where you are on your journey to standards-based system simulation! We are going to add further partners in the coming months.
