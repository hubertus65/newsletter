MBI is the only one-stop shop for solutions based on the Modelica Association standards based in the United States. In addition to to tool and library sales, 
we also provide services to help you set up your processes to successfully use model based design for innovative product development.    

#### [Tool Updates](https://modelbased.cloud/tools/)

[Modelon Impact](https://modelon.com/modelon-impact/) is our tool of choice for Modelica due to its cloud-based nature that makes collaboration and integration so much easier. 
We offer Modelon Impact with fully supported extensions and add-ons to integrate it with controls design. This includes the [FMI-Toolbox](https://modelon.com/fmi-toolbox/) 
for seamless integration into Simulink and [PMSFIT FMIBench](https://modelbased.cloud/tools/fmi/) for FMI integration and co-simulation, supporting both FMI and SSP. 
For [orchideo \| easySSP](https://www.exxcellent.de/orchideo-easy-ssp) we now offer extended examples and getting-started training. News about their latest release is in eXXcellent solutions section in this newsletter.  

In the combination of these tools, this covers needs for standards-based system simulation for everything from small customers to enterprise needs. 

#### [Libraries]((https://modelbased.cloud/libraries/)
For Libraries, our main Modelica platform is Modelon Impact, but we work with other tools as well, especially for open-source libraries, and extending open-source libraries. MBI has adapted some open source libraries to fully work with Modelon Impact, for Example

#### [Training](https://modelbased.cloud/services/)
- We offer basic and advanced Modelica training for customers that need to get started quickly, and for those that want to go more in depth. Our Modelica training is done on cloud-based Modelon Impact, which allows to provide training without any installation hassles. We also offer training on integrating Modelon Impact into heterogeneous tool landscapes and existing product design workflows.
- Modelica is very well suited for controls design, analysis and verification. We offer specialized training and support for all topics related to modeling for controls. With the Python integration of Modelon Impact offers integration with excellent Python packages for Control. MBI also provides specialized libraries for Controls development. 
  



#### [International Modelica Conference 2025](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/#registration-and-accommodation)
Most new users of simulation solutions will need some getting-started services. 

- Training for new and advanced users, for tools, and libraries. We offer advanced Modelica training, as  Here our focus is on controls-oriented modeling and design workflows, and modeling at the right level of complexity for the use case. 
- Customization of products for specific workflows and integration with in-house data and custom tools, es
- Customization and add-ons for commercial modeling libraries. For this, we work with our partners, to that we work with tailored know-how and specialists for all products in our portfolio.
- Development of custom model libraries and solutions
- Getting-started services for Model-Based Design, developing the right processes for your company size and mission, including the integration with systems engineering   

With the above portfolio, [MBI LLC](https://modelbased.cloud/) will select the right solution for you, no matter where you are on your journey to standards-based system simulation! We are going to add further partners in the coming months.
