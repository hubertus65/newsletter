Indeed, there might be more users of Modelica in China than in the rest of the world combined! *[...](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2025-02/index#letter-from-the-board)* I will come back to this topic in future newsletters and report on very concrete actions that are undertaken in this direction.

Have fun with the [newsletter](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2025-02/index)* and see you at the conference!
