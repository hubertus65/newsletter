## News from the FMI Project

The FMI Project actively maintains the FMI 2.0.x and 3.0.x standards, and currently focusses on the development of Layered Standards to extend FMI for new application domains:

* [FMI-LS-XCP](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp) v1.0.0 released in Dec 2024: This layered standard defines support for [XCP](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-1-xcp/) or “Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol”, a network protocol defined by [ASAM](https://www.asam.net/). 
* [FMI-LS-BUS](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus) v1.0.0 just released, see below. This layered standard defines how to realize the simulation of network communication with FMI 3.0 means.
* [FMI-LS-STRUCT](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct) v1.0.0-alpha.1 prerelease: Based on FMI 3.0, this layered standard defines how variables (especially parameters) of an FMU can be structured and grouped in a more flexible way than with the “structured naming convention” of the FMI Standard. The first version of this layered standard is focused on the definition of sampled maps.
* [FMI-LS-REF](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-ref) (in development). It will allow for the inclusion of related files into an FMU. This includes parameter sets, reference stimuli and results, which can be used in additional experiments, as well as other relevant files to the FMU, like the model sources, requirements, or specifications.

Additionally two new working groups for the improvement of efficiency of data communication between FMUs and for DAE support have been formed.

### The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication v1.0 has been released - enabling the simulation of virtual ECUs with FMI 3.0!

![FMI-LS-BUS](FMI-LS-BUS.png)

Increasingly complex supply chains and functional diversity in the creation of virtual ECUs (vECUs) require standardization to ensure the simple and cost-efficient exchange of vECUs for users of Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) testing solutions. FMI is an established standard for creating vECUs already using the FMI versions 1.0 and 2.0, but the capabilities for these applications has been improved significantly with the release of FMI 3.0 in 2022. Additionally FMI 3.0 allows for the specification of layered standards. These are defined based on the FMI 3.0 core standard and extend its capability for specific usage domains, in the case of the new Layered Standard the network Communication of vECUs:

CAN, CAN FD, CAN XL, LIN, FlexRay and Ethernet are network technologies that have been applied successfully over many years by all automotive OEMs worldwide. Virtualizing ECUs and then simulating such vECUs requires connecting them using a virtual version of these network technologies.

The layered standard defines what input and output variables and which FMI 3.0 features are used and how to emulate a transport layer for such network traffic. At this point it should be explicitly mentioned that this layered standard not only relates to automotive buses, but can also be extended to buses from other domains in the future.

There are two base use cases enabled:

- Physical Signal Abstraction (or High-Cut) to simply transport physical signal values between virtual ECUs:
The network properties are largely idealized: Infinite bandwidth, zero-delay etc. Signals, groups of signals and their properties (e.g., units) are usually derived from existing and validated standard network topology description formats, such as DBC, LDF, Fibex and ARXML.
- Network Abstraction (or Low-Cut) to realize virtualized bus driver implementations:
This transport layer emulation allows anything from idealized to more detailed network simulations, including bandwidth restrictions, message arbitration and delays. It forwards the network payloads using binary variables. The Low-Cut abstraction layer is meant to allow virtualized bus driver implementations, including feedback from the physical drivers about transmission status or network node states. Since the Network Abstraction layer is protocol-independent, it can also be used for the simulation of non-automotive control units, e.g., from the field of industrial automation.

The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) has been created in a collaborative effort by a working group within the FMI Project with contributions from Akkodis, AVL, Beckhoff, Bosch, dSPACE, PMSF and Synopsys (in alphabetical order). 

The FMI Steering Committee has now released the version v1.0 of the FMI 3.0 Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS). This version includes the common Physical Signal Abstraction, that fits for all bus types, and the Network Abstraction that supports CAN, CAN FD, CAN XL. Additionally a pre-release of FMI-LS-BS v1.1.0-beta was published supporting the next planned bus types FlexRay and Ethernet. A chronological overview of the supported and planned bus types can be found in the [FMI-LS-BUS Roadmap](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap).

The new Layered Standard has been heavily tested during the development, and already is supported by the following tools: 
Altair Twin Activate, AVL Model.CONNECT, dSPACE SystemDesk, dSPACE VEOS, Synopsys Silver, Vector SIL Kit, Vector vVIRTUALtarget (for more information see  https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus)

The FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication is accompanied by other layered standards to improve the simulation of vECUs: 

- The FMI-LS-XCP (v1.0 released, see https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp) which enables the measurements via the ASAM XCP standard
- The FMI Layered Standard for the Structuring of data (FMI-LS-STRUCT, v1.0-alpha available, see https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct) which defines support for maps.

Together they represent a significant part of the functionality required for carrying out SiL tests in vECUs by using the popular FMI 3.0 standard. 
They enable the faster exchange of vECUs and give users the option of tool freedom when creating and simulating vECUs. Ultimately, this reduces the process complexity for exchanging and makes it significantly more cost-efficient to create and simulate vECUs. 

We will present the new Layered Standard for Network communication also at the coming "16th International Modelica and FMI Conference" in Lucerne, Sept 8-10 2025, in our talk "FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication: Applications in Networked ECU Development". [Come and meet us there](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/)!
